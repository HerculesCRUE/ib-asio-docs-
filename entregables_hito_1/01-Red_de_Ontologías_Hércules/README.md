# README

This document lists and briefly describes the ttl files corresponding to the Hercules ontologies, namely:

- [asio-core.ttl](asio-core.ttl)
- [asio-mappings.ttl](asio-mappings.ttl)
- [asio-module-geopol.ttl](asio-module-geopol.ttl)
- [asio-module-scientificdomains.ttl](asio-module-scientificdomains.ttl)
- [asio-module-subjectareas.ttl](asio-module-subjectareas.ttl)
- [asio-module-universities.ttl](asio-module-universities.ttl)

The first one is the ***core*** ontology and the second one corresponds to the class-by-class ***alignements*** towards external vocabularies

In addition to these two files, a number of ***vertical modules*** have being released at the moment of this writing. The earliest release was the **geopolitical module** (the third file listed above) including so far the full list of world's countries, the geopolitical entities of Andorra, Spain and Portugal (France is the other country to be taken into account in this vertical module in the next update).

Two other vertical modules, related within each other, are the **scientific domains** and the **subject areas**. Both are controlled vocabularies including scientific domains and fields and used in different requirements by the core ontology.

Finally, the vertical module **universities** included the full list of universities from Spain with a limited sample of university subdivisions (centres, campus, faculties, etc.) corresponding to the Murcia, Oviedo, Santiago de Compostela and Basque contry universities.
