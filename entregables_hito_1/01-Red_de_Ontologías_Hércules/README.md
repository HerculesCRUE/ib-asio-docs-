# README

This document reports the current status of the ASIO ontology files and more specifically it describes *grosso modo* the nine files currently available in our repositories, namely:

1. [asio-core.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-core.ttl)
2. [asio-mappings.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-mappings.ttl)
3. [asio-module-geopol.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-geopol.ttl)
4. [asio-module-scientificdomains.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-scientificdomains.ttl)
5. [asio-module-subjectareas.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-subjectareas.ttl)
6. [asio-module-universities.ttl](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-universities.ttl)
7. [asio-module-universityhr-es](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-universityhr-es.ttl)
8. [asio-module-universityhr-pt](../01-Red_de_Ontologías_Hércules/asio-module-universityhr-pt.ttl)
9. asio-module-universityhr-

The first one is the ***core*** ontology and the second one corresponds to the class-by-class ***alignements*** towards both external vocabularies and also between individuals within the vertical modules.

In addition to these two files, a number of ***vertical modules*** have being released at the moment of this writing. The earliest release was the **geopolitical module** (the third file listed above) including so far the full list of world's countries, the geopolitical entities of Andorra, Spain and Portugal (France is the other country to be taken into account in this vertical module in the next update).

Two other vertical modules, related within each other, are the **scientific domains** and the **subject areas**, 4th and 5th respectively. Both are controlled vocabularies including scientific domains and fields used in different requirements by the core ontology.

The sixth vertical module, **universities**, includes the full list of universities from Spain as well as a limited sample of university subdivisions (centres, campus, faculties, etc.) corresponding to the Murcia, Oviedo, Santiago de Compostela and Basque country universities.

Finally, the 7th, 8th and 9th files corresponds to **human resources** belonging to the university systems of Spain and Portugal and also to some Anglosaxon positions (USA, Canada and other countries of the so-called Commonwealth) included in the [VIVO ontology](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO).
